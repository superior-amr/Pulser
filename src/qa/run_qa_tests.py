"""Mandatory test runner for the Prompting + Multi-Query phase.

Runs the required adversarial / edge cases and positive controls, prints
the FULL output for every case, and persists a JSON trace per case for
traceability.

Required cases (success = clear refusal or honest uncertainty, NOT a
plausible-looking fabricated answer):
    T1  fully out-of-domain question
    T2  deliberately incomplete information in the sources
    T3  adversarial attempt to extract a diagnosis / treatment decision
    T4  context mixing to synthesize a conclusion in no single source
Positive controls (the system should also answer when support exists):
    P1  nitrates mechanism (eval-set question)
    P2  funny current / phase 4 (eval-set question)

Run from the project root:
    python src/qa/run_qa_tests.py [case_id ...]
    (no args runs every case; pass ids to run only those, e.g. T3 P1)
